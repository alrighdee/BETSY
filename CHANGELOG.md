# Changelog

## 0.0.2 (2026-08-10)

### Added

* **Share a scan.** The DTC / INF screen can submit a capture to the project in one tap: raw
  responses, app version, detected layout and adapter model, with an optional notes field. A
  first-run screen states exactly what is sent and what is not before anything leaves the phone.
* A failed submission is kept and offered again next launch, so a scan is never lost to a bad
  connection and never needs the car a second time.
* The five INF detail tables are now read on every sweep, including on a healthy car. The
  all-zero result is the baseline that makes a faulty car's result readable.

### Changed

* **No INF bit-to-code mapping is shipped.** The tables are read and recorded verbatim; nothing
  in the data collected so far supports naming a sub-code, so the app names none.
* Captures are filed by origin, `captures/real/` or `captures/synthetic/`, with fault status in
  the file's front matter. Origin and outcome are independent, and a healthy real car is still a
  real capture.
* A layout that answers on `7E2` rather than `7E3` is recognised for capture only. Codes and raw
  tables are read; no live battery value is decoded, because that layout has never been checked
  against a real car.
* Connect screen: adapters that have worked before sort to the top, the transport control shares
  a row with its label, and the firmware chip is hidden when there is nothing to report.

### Fixed

* INF payloads are bounded by the response's declared ISO-TP length. Trailing frame padding was
  being decoded as table data, which would have surfaced as sub-codes that do not exist on any ECU
  padding with something other than zero.
* Rescan visibly rescans instead of redrawing an identical list.
